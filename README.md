### V1.0 feature release and stories

* As a client, once I open the application I want to visualize the current available products in stock;
* As a client, by clicking on a specific product I want to see all the details, pictures and costs associated to it
* As a client, I want to be able to add as many products I like in a cart, and execute the checkout by using credit/debit card, and being able to provide my billing and delivery details.
* As a client, I want to manage my orders, visualize their status,and being able to cancel an order. If I cancel the order within 24 hours, I am able to receive a refound.
